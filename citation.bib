    abstract = "We report on experiments on information extraction (IE) from EU Acquis, the European Union law. We introduce a new IE task of Information Provision Activity Requirement Extraction. This task comprises the identification of text fragments that introduce an obligation to provide information, and the extraction of structured information about the key entities involved along with the temporal modalities. We compare various technologies for this task, i.e. knowledge-, classical ML-, transformer-, and generative AI-based approaches, on a new benchmark corpus."
